The MapBloack class is very simple and maintainable. 
Currently it is not fully implemented however the implementation is straightforward and easy to understand. 
The class is well organized and easy to read. 
The properties are clearly defined and the methods are straightforward.
Going forward it is easy to implement Update() if nessesary and for a static background class it is functional and maintainable as is.
Going forward this class may have collision implemented to it however doing so may require some refactoring.
