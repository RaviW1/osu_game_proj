Overall the code is compact and very succinct. None of the methods are longer than 5
and the overall implementation is very strong.
One issue I find for readability is the use of some more obscure C# syntax.
Specifically,  the use of "?" on assigning left/right keys and assigning AxisX. I'm not sure if 
this is a result of my lack of C# knowledge, but, while being succinct, I found those 
lines difficult to immediately understand, especially considering the lack of surrounding context.
Additionally, the use of -1, 0, 1 for axis, while easily inferred, could use some 
better documentation to alleviate any potential confusion
