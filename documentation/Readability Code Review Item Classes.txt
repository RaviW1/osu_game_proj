Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

- All of the implemented methods were under five lines long, nice and short

- For the IItem interface, it seemed fairly obvious at a first glance what each method does, except for OnSelect() and OnDeselect(). These names could possibly be changed to be a bit more descriptive in terms of what the method does

- For the TextureItem class, some of the C# language was unfamiliar to me, specifically what the Action<Player> type is and the "?" and ":" operators, as well as what the Invoke() method does; based on member names and other context, I was still generally able to get an idea of what the methods do, although the details of the implementation I couldn't 100% understand

- The ItemManager class was generally very easy to understand, although I still don't get what OnSelect() and OnDeselect() are supposed to do even after seeing them in context

Overall this code is quite readable. The only changes I would suggest are related to the OnSelect() and OnDeselect methods; either the names should be changed to better describe their function, or a descriptive comment should be included in their implementation.
