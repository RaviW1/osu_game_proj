The class is fairly succinct and that allows it to maintained easily. I had to 
make some adjustments, and it was very easy for me to insert my own code.
Generally, the deesign of the command structure makes it very easy to differentiate
different types of keystrokes and that made implementing movement when held down vs
pressed alot simpler. One problem I have seen, however, is how this class is called.
All the Commands, this class included, are linked with the keyboard and created in 
the Game class load content method. This results in a very messy, difficult to maintain Game class, which I would prefer to contain as
little functional code as possible.
Overall the design of this class and the ICommand interface that you designed, allows
very easy implementation of new functionality. For example, implementing the character 
sprite flipping base on direction is much easier because this command directly 
passes the direction information to the player class.
Additionally, remapping, horizontal movement requires a two line change, and so does 
adding additional movement key options.
