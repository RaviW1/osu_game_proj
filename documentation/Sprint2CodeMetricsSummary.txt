Code Metrics analysis:

Overall our code metrics are strong. We are in a good spot to add more functionality without creating spagetti code.
We have an average maintability score of 87.82.
We have an average cyclomatic complixity of 2.6
Some outliers in our code metrics were the Player class and Game1 class.
Both of these classes have a lot of functionality and are doing a lot of work, which is reflected in their higher cyclomatic complexity and lines of code. 
However, this is somewhat expected given the nature of these classes as they are central to the game logic and player functionality.
We may look to refactor and simplify these classes in the future.
