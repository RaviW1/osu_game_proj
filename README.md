We have implemented our version of the game Hollow Knight  
The control scheme is:  
A/D or left/right arrow keys to move the knight left and right, respectively  
Space to jump  
e to activate a damage state  
q to quit  
r to reset  
z or n to attack  
1 to shoot a projectile
2 to heal  
t or y to cycle between displayed blocks  
u or i to cycle displayed charm  
o or p to cycle currently shown enemy  

## Known bugs 
There is a problem with the knight moving extra fast when using both left/right and the arrow keys  
Additionally, many of the current sprites are placeholders and will hopefully be replaced in the future
